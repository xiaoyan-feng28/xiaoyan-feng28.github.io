Current, I am seeking a Ph.D. position that combines machine learning, GIS, and their applications in economics and finance.

I graduated from [School of Material Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/materials/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). My research interest includes surface modification, microshperes synthesis, machine learning, and computational simulation.

My primary research interests focus on integrating machine learning and GIS technologies into economics and finance, particularly through GeoAI and ScienceAI, to enhance insights and applications.
