Current, I am seeking a Ph.D. position that combines biomaterial, machine learning, and their applications in medical use.

I graduated from [School of Material Science and Engineering](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/materials/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/). My primary research interests focus on integrating biomaterial polymer and machine learning into practical use, particularly through organic synthesis, surface modification, and computational simulation to enhance insights and applications.
